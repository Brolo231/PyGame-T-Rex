# 🦖 Modular T-Rex Runner — Built with PyGame

## 🎮 A homage to the classic Google Chrome offline T-Rex game

This project is a Python game built using PyGame, inspired by the well-known Chrome T-Rex runner. It was developed as part of my learning journey to deepen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), particularly focusing on how to build games using modular design patterns with classes, methods, and variables working together cleanly.

The game structure separates logic into distinct modules — for example: Player, Environment, Menu, and Game classes — making it easier to maintain, scale, and understand.

## 🎯 Game Objectives
- Survive for as long as possible by jumping over or ducking under obstacles (trees and birds).
- The game speed increases over time, making it progressively harder.
- Your score increases with each obstacle passed, and the game tracks your high score between runs.
